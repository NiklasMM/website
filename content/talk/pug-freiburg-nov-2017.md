# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """
Software testing is a huge topic ranging from manual testing to automated distributed testing in huge server farms.

Today, we'll look at the very basics. What do we need testing for and what tools does the Python ecosystem provide for us. If you think this is just for professional, think again... or better yet: come by and find out yourself.

We will start looking at the de-facto standard tool pytest and depending on the audience can look at other things like coverage.py or mock.

Please bring all your questions regarding this topic and related ones, so we can make this session as interactive as possible.
