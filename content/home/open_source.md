* [coala](https://www.coala.io) - coala provides a unified interface for linting and fixing code with a single configuration file, regardless of the programming languages used. I met the great team of coala at pycon.de 2016 in Munich and have since contributed some code and mentored at Google Summer of Code 2017.

* [Borg Backup](https://www.borgbackup.org/) - A backup tool written in Python. Borg is a very powerfull and flexible deduplicating backup tool. I use it at work and at home and have also contributed to this great project.

* [pytest](https://www.pytest.org) - The best testrunner for Python and better as most I've seen in other languages. Makes it really easy to get into testing in Python and has a powerfull toolbox for experts to really make the most of your tests.
