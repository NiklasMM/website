I'm a Software Engineer from Freiburg, Germany. I work mostly with Python and web technology. I believe in the power of open source and try to contribute whenever I can. I like to visit conferences and give talks about my favorite topics from the Pythonsphere.

In my free time I volunteer for the German Red Cross or get out into the nature and go for a hike.
